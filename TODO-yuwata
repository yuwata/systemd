networkd
- Add many many json entries:
    * LLDP entries,
    * DHCP server lease,
    * sd_dhcp_lease, sd_dhcp6_lease, sd_ndisc_router.
- Improve logs:
    * introduce log_address_error_errno() or friends,
    * generate more informative error message in netlink handler.
- Introduce MaxLogLevel= in .network and .netdev.
- Add more tests:
    * for 'networkctl reconfigure',
    * for generated json formats,
    * for IPv6RoutePrefix=.
- Support reconfiguring netdevs.
- Save runtime settings (DNS, NTP, and etc), and read it when networkd is restarted.
  (resolved does so)
- Save WireGuard sessions and read it when networkd is restarted.
- Add netns support (#14915):
    * make PID1 support named netns,
    * introduce varlink methods:
        1. describe: dump manager and link info
        2. reload: reloading .network files
        3. reconfigure: reconfigure interface
      Note, the describe method should not require any privilege, but 2. and 3. require.
      Does the current varlink implementation support that?
      Or, two varlink server should run in networkd??
    * introduce Namespace= setting in [Network] or [Link] section to transport interfaces to the specified namespace.
    * introduce Namespace= setting in [Peer] section for veth.
    * introduce Namespace= setting in [Match] section to control which file should be loaded.
- Add TC filter support (#18389).
- Set expiration time for DHCPv4 routes.
- Introduce sd_dhcp_lease_get_timestamp().
- IPv4ACD not supported on bond?
- Improve L2TP handling:
    * introduce 'networkctl l2tp-connect' and 'l2tp-disconnect'.
- Reconsider [Match] Name= or OriginalName= logic.

networkctl
- Use json data and not directly call netlink command or read udev database.
- Introduce 'networkctl cat' and `networkctl edit`
- Introduce 'networkctl speed-meter' which tentatively enables speed meter, show speed periodically,
  and disable it on exit.
